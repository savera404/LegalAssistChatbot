**Case Name:**  
Kaura and Others Petitioners v. Allah Ditta and Others Respondents  

**Court:**  
Lahore High Court  

**Year:**  
2000  

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the petitioners (Taggi and her successors) are entitled to a one‑sixth share of Lakhu’s estate and whether the subsequent transfers of the disputed land were lawful, in light of customary inheritance rules and the limitation period.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Civil Procedure Code (1908) – Order XIV, Rule 1; Order VII, Rule 3; Section 115; Section 99; Order XXXII, Rule 3  
- Specific Relief Act (1877) – Section 42  
- Limitation Act (1908) – Article 120  
- West Pakistan Land Revenue Act (1967) – Section 42  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
- Taggi, claimed to be the daughter of Lakhu, filed a suit for declaration and permanent injunction over 100 kanals of land in 1992.  
- Lakhu died in 1944; his property was transferred to his heirs (Pheri, Masso, etc.) and subsequently to other persons.  
- Defendants argued that Taggi was not Lakhu’s daughter and that customary law excluded women from inheritance.  
- Trial court held that Taggi was entitled to a one‑sixth share and granted the suit.  
- An appeal was dismissed by the Additional District Judge.  
- Petitioners filed a civil revision under Section 115, challenging the trial court’s judgment and decree.  

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Lahore High Court dismissed the civil revision, affirmed the trial court’s judgment and decree, and upheld the finding that Taggi was entitled to a one‑sixth share of the estate. The Court held that the issues pleaded were properly framed and that the suit was not barred by limitation.  

**Legal Principle Established:**  
A court may not settle issues that were not pleaded by the parties; issues must be framed in accordance with the pleadings. Customary law must be proven and applied only when properly established; the limitation period for a suit for declaration begins from the date of adverse entry in the record of rights.
