**Case Name:**  
Ehsan‑ul‑Haq and others v. Muhammad Nawaz and others  

**Court:**  
Supreme Court of Pakistan (Appellate Jurisdiction)  

**Year:**  
2025 (judgment delivered 20 Feb 2025)  

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the appellants, as legal heirs of Muhammad Yousaf, are entitled to a half‑share in the property that was mutated to Mst. Ghulam Zohra under a will that contained a condition of limited ownership.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962 – Section 2‑A (recognition of male heirs of customary land as absolute owners)  
- Islamic inheritance principles (rule of one‑third in testamentary disposition)  
- Customary law applicable before the Shariat Application Act, 1948  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Kala Khan owned land in Jhelum; died 1934.  
2. Property was mutated to his daughter, Mst. Ghulam Zohra, by will (mutations 2482 & 83 8).  
3. Will contained a condition that she would be a limited owner until death.  
4. Mst. Ghulam Zohra died 1988; she had transferred portions of the land to respondents.  
5. Appellants claim that, as heirs of Muhammad Yousaf (last surviving male of Kala Khan), they are entitled to half the property.  

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Supreme Court held that the condition of limited ownership in the will was void under Islamic inheritance law; consequently, Mst. Ghulam Zohra became the absolute owner of the property. Upon her death, the property devolved to her legal heirs (the respondents), not to the appellants.  

**Legal Principle Established:**  
A condition in a Muslim will that limits ownership to a life‑interest is void; the property transferred by such a will becomes absolute ownership. Male heirs who acquired customary land before 15 March 1948 are recognized as absolute owners under Islamic law, and the one‑third rule governs testamentary dispositions.
