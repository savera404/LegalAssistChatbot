**Case Name:**  
YASIR KALWAR v. Mst. FARZEEN and others  

**Court:**  
Sindh High Court  

**Year:**  
2024 (decision dated 24 September 2024)  

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether custody of the minor daughters of the petitioner may be transferred to him under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, after the mother’s second marriage to a stranger not related within the prohibited degree.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 – Section 25 (application for custody)  
- Principles of Muhammadan Law – paragraphs 352 and 354 (effects of a mother’s second marriage on custody)  
- Concept of Haznat (right of custody of a mother)  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Petitioner Yasin Kalwar is the father of two minor daughters, Baby Iman (≈16/17 yrs) and Baby Aaira (≈13/14 yrs).  
2. Respondent Mst. Farzeen, the ex‑wife, has entered into a second marriage with a stranger not related to the children within the prohibited degree.  
3. Petitioner previously applied under Section 25 of the Act; the application and subsequent appeals were dismissed.  
4. Respondent argues that the petitioner, a CSS officer posted in various cities, cannot provide stable custody; petitioner counters that he resides in a joint family in Karachi and that his mother can care for the children in his absence.  
5. No evidence of exceptional circumstances justifying the mother’s continued custody was presented.  

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Court set aside the earlier orders, allowed the petition, and granted custody of the minor daughters to the petitioner. The mother is entitled to visitation on any day once a week or as mutually agreed.  

**Legal Principle Established:**  
When a mother contracts a second marriage with a stranger not related within the prohibited degree, her right of Haznat is forfeited; custody may be transferred to the father unless exceptional circumstances justify the mother’s continued custody. The welfare and best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in custody determinations.
