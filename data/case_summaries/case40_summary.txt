Supreme Court of Pakistan (Appellate Jurisdiction)

**Year:**  
2025

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the petitioner is entitled to recover 11 tolas of gold ornaments allegedly gifted by respondent No.1 and subsequently snatched from her.

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
Not specified

**Key Facts (brief):**  
- Petitioner filed a suit on 31‑07‑2021 seeking recovery of 11 tolas of gold ornaments.  
- She claimed the ornaments were gifted by respondent No.1 and snatched from her in September 2020 when she left her matrimonial home.  
- Respondent admitted making the ornaments but denied snatching them.  
- Family court (22‑12‑2022) dismissed the claim.  
- Appellate court (27‑03‑2023) allowed the claim, holding petitioner entitled to recovery.  
- Lahore High Court (writ petition No.1644/2023) set aside the appellate court’s judgment, restoring the family court’s decision.  
- Supreme Court remands the matter to the appellate court for reconsideration of the petitioner’s entitlement based on the evidence.

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Supreme Court set aside the appellate court’s judgment and decree dated 27‑03‑2023 and remanded the case to the appellate court, directing it to decide the question of the petitioner’s entitlement to the 11 tolas of gold ornaments on the basis of the evidence on record.

**Legal Principle Established:**  
An appellate court must reconsider the question of entitlement to property based on the evidence presented, rather than substitute its own views; the Supreme Court may remand for such reconsideration when the appellate court’s decision is found to be based on surmises or conjectures.
