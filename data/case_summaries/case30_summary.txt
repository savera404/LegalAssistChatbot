**Case Name:** P L D 2025 Peshawar 110  
**Court:** Peshawar High Court (Civil Revision)  
**Year:** 2023 (decision dated 19 October 2023)  
**Legal Issue:** Whether the entry of Bibi Hawa as a full owner in the revenue record and the subsequent mutation in her favour were lawful, given that she was a widow of the deceased land‑owner and was recorded as a limited owner under custom.  
**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Qanun‑e‑Shahadat (10 of 1984)  
- Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP) Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1935  
- West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962  
- Supreme Court precedent: *Maqbool Ahmad v. Fazal‑i‑Haq* (2012 SCMR 917) and *Additional Settlement Commissioner (Land) Sargoda v. Muhammad Shafi* (1971 SC 791).  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. The disputed property was originally owned by Gul Mian and divided equally among his four sons: Alam Gul, Mir Muhammad, Gul Ahmad, and Ayub.  
2. Ayub died without issue; his widow, Bibi Hawa, was recorded in the revenue record as owner of a 1/4 share (the share of Ayub) and later as a full owner.  
3. Petitioners are the sons of Alam Gul, Mir Muhammad, and Gul Ahmad; respondents are siblings of Bibi Hawa.  
4. Petitioners allege that Bibi Hawa was a limited owner under custom and that the mutation in her favour (and subsequent transfer to her heirs) was illegal and ineffective.  
5. The lower courts dismissed the suit and the appeal, holding that the petitioners failed to prove their claim.  

**Holding / Decision:** Not specified (the excerpt ends before the final judgment).  

**Legal Principle Established:** Not specified (the excerpt references Supreme Court precedent that a widow recorded as a limited owner under custom cannot be treated as a full owner; upon her death, the property reverts to the legal heirs of the last male owner).
