**Case Name:**  
Civil Petition No.354‑P of 2025 (Saleh Muhammad and another vs. Mst. Mehnaz Begum and others)

**Court:**  
Supreme Court of Pakistan (Appellate Jurisdiction)

**Year:**  
2025

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the Supreme Court should grant leave to appeal the Peshawar High Court’s judgment affirming the respondent’s claim for dower, dowry articles, and maintenance, and whether the petitioner’s repeated allegations that the respondent was not a “female” and was infertile constitute a legal error warranting intervention.

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
Not specified in the judgment.

**Key Facts (brief):**  
- Marriage solemnised 2006; petitioner abandoned respondent in 2007 and entered a second marriage in 2009.  
- Respondent filed suit in 2015 for dower, dowry, and maintenance.  
- Petitioner repeatedly alleged respondent was not a female and was infertile, seeking to deny her entitlements.  
- Trial, District, and High Courts found respondent to be female and allowed her claim.  
- Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking leave to appeal.

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, denied leave to appeal, and imposed exemplary costs of Rs. 500,000 on the petitioner, payable to the respondent.

**Legal Principle Established:**  
The Supreme Court will not disturb concurrent findings of lower courts unless a clear legal error is apparent; frivolous or abusive litigation that humiliates a vulnerable party, particularly a woman, may be sanctioned with exemplary costs to deter such conduct.
