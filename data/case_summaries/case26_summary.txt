**Case Name:**  
Mst. Farishta v. Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Law, Islamabad  

**Court:**  
Peshawar High Court (Shariat Bench)  

**Year:**  
1979  

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether Section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, which provides for the inheritance of children of a pre‑deceased son or daughter, is repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam (Qur’an and Sunnah) and whether the Shariat Bench has jurisdiction to examine it under Article 203‑B of the Constitution.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 – Articles 203‑A to 203‑D (including Article 203‑B and its Explanation)  
- Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 – Section 4  
- West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962 – Section 2  
- Constitution, Article 8(3)(b) (protection of Muslim Personal Law)  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Mst. Farishta filed a petition under Article 203‑B seeking a declaration that Section 4 of the Ordinance is repugnant to Islam.  
2. The petition was heard by the Shariat Bench on 8–9 September 1979, with counsel for the petitioner and the Advocate‑General.  
3. The central questions were: (i) whether the Bench had jurisdiction under Article 203‑B; (ii) whether the Qur’an excludes the children of a pre‑deceased son in the presence of a living son; and (iii) whether the Sunnah conflicts with Section 4.  

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Bench held that Section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, is not repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam and is a valid part of Muslim Personal Law. The Bench affirmed its jurisdiction under Article 203‑B to examine the provision.  

**Legal Principle Established:**  
The Shariat Bench may examine statutory provisions that are part of Muslim Personal Law (Shariat). A statute that is not intrinsically part of Shariat cannot be declared repugnant; provisions consistent with Shariat are upheld. The expression “Muslim Personal Law” in the Constitution refers to Shariat, not to all legislative enactments.
