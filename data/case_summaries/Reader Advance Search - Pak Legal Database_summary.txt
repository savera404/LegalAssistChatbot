**Case Name:**  
Syed Sajid Abbas Rizvi v Mst. Naureen and Others  

**Court:**  
Sindh High Court  

**Year:**  
2013  

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the proviso attached to Section 10 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 is unconstitutional, contrary to Shariah and the Constitution, and whether the petitioner’s failure to file a written statement and to comply with Family Court orders warrants dismissal of the Constitutional Petition.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 – Section 10 (Pre‑trial proceedings) and its proviso  
- Constitution of Pakistan – Article 199 (Islamic Law)  
- Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Section 151 (Application for reference to higher court)  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
- Petition filed by respondents 1‑4 (wife and minor children) for dissolution of marriage (Khula) and maintenance on 30‑04‑2012.  
- Petitioner (husband) did not file a written statement; ex‑parte order issued 17‑08‑2012.  
- Petitioner filed multiple applications under Section 151 (21‑11‑2012, 14‑12‑2012) seeking delay and reference to the High Court.  
- Family Court dismissed these applications on 21‑12‑2012, directing petitioner to file a written statement by 24‑12‑2012.  
- Petitioner filed the Constitutional Petition on 23‑01‑2013, alleging that the proviso in Section 10 violates Shariah and the Constitution.  

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Sindh High Court dismissed the Constitutional Petition. It held that:  
1. The proviso in Section 10 does not render the main provisions of the section unconstitutional or contrary to Shariah.  
2. The petitioner lacked locus standi to challenge the statutory provision.  
3. The petitioner’s failure to file a written statement and to comply with the Family Court’s orders justified the ex‑parte order and the dismissal of his applications.  

**Legal Principle Established:**  
A proviso attached to a statutory section operates as an exception and does not invalidate or render ineffective the substantive provisions of that section; procedural compliance (e.g., filing a written statement) is mandatory, and a petitioner who fails to comply may be denied relief and subject to ex‑parte orders.
