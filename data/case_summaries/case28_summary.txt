**Case Name:**  
Civil Petition No. 5009 of 2024 (Petitioner: Muhammad Imran Baqir vs. Mst. Zarnain Arzoo & others)

**Court:**  
Supreme Court of Pakistan (Appellate Jurisdiction)

**Year:**  
2025

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the Supreme Court should alter the quantum of maintenance allowance awarded to the petitioner’s minor son by the lower courts.

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Article 185(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973  
- Islamic jurisprudence on maintenance (Nasab)  
- Case law: *Humayun Hassan v. Arsalan Hassan* (PLD 2013 SC 557)

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Mst. Zarnain Arzoo, former spouse of the petitioner, sued for dower, maintenance for herself and their minor son, and dowry articles.  
2. Trial Court (20 Nov 2021) awarded Rs. 15,000/month to the wife and Rs. 25,000/month to the son (with a 10 % annual increase until majority).  
3. Appellate Court (06 Apr 2022) reduced the wife’s maintenance to Rs. 10,000/month and adjusted dower values.  
4. The petitioner filed a Constitution Petition, which was dismissed by the Lahore High Court (03 Oct 2024).  
5. The petitioner now seeks leave to appeal the maintenance amount.

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and declined leave to appeal, affirming the lower courts’ findings and refusing to alter the maintenance award.

**Legal Principle Established:**  
A father’s obligation to provide maintenance for a minor child is independent of marital status and persists until the child attains majority; the amount awarded by the courts is not excessive absent evidence of the father’s inability to pay.
