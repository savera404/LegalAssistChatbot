**Case Name:**  
Wajiha Rasheed v. Adeel Akhter and Others (CPLA Nos. 2555 & 2556 of 2022)

**Court:**  
Supreme Court of Pakistan (Appellate Jurisdiction)

**Year:**  
2025 (judgment dated 27 Aug 2025)

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the petitioner is entitled to retain the dower and ownership of Plot No. 6 after the dissolution of her marriage, and whether an earlier family‑court decree declaring the plot to be hers can be set aside.

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- West‑Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 – Section 10(4) (dissolution of marriage)  
- Amendments to Section 10(5) & (6) under the Punjab Family Courts (Amendment) Act, 2015  
- (No other statutes cited)

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Marriage of petitioner and respondent on 05 Apr 2001; rukhsa on 28 Jun 2004.  
2. Dower fixed at Rs. 10,00,000 and Plot No. 6 (Sector‑D, Ghazikot Township, Mansehra) as part of dower.  
3. Plot sold by respondent’s father to Riaz Ahmed; petitioner sued for declaration of ownership (Suit No. 216/FC 2010) – decree 18 Oct 2011.  
4. Dissolution of marriage ordered by family court on 08 Nov 2012 (Family Suit No. 45 2012).  
5. Family court held petitioner failed to prove cruelty; ordered return of dower; denied claim to gold ornaments.  
6. High‑court judgments on 17 Mar 2022 upheld the family‑court decree and denied petitioner’s claim to dower.  
7. Supreme Court hearing on 27 Aug 2025.

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Supreme Court affirmed the high‑court decision that, because the marriage was dissolved by khula, the petitioner is not entitled to retain the dower. Consequently, the earlier decree declaring ownership of Plot No. 6 is set aside, and the petitioner must return the dower. The amendments to the Family Courts Act are not applied retroactively.

**Legal Principle Established:**  
A subsequent dissolution of marriage can negate earlier property rights conferred by dower; courts may set aside earlier decrees if later judgments show the petitioner was not entitled to the dower. Amendments to family‑court law are not retroactive.
