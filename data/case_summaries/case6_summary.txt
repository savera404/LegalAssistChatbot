**Case Name:**  
MST. MAH BIBI (PETITIONER) VERSUS KHUDADAD AND 2 OTHERS RESPONDENTS  

**Court:**  
BALOCHISTAN HIGH COURT  

**Year:**  
2004  

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the petitioner’s application for restoration of a suit dismissed for non‑prosecution was barred by the limitation period, and whether the dismissal of the suit and the subsequent appeal were proper.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965 – Rule 12(2)  
- West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 – Sections 5, 8, 9, 10 (and Schedule)  
- Limitation Act, 1908 – Article 163 (30‑day period for restoration of suit dismissed for non‑prosecution)  
- Civil Procedure Code, 1908 – Article 181  
- Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 – Article 199 (constitutional jurisdiction)  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Petitioner filed a suit for maintenance allowance for her Iddat period in the Qazi Court cum Judge Family Court, Dasht, Turbat, on 8‑5‑2003.  
2. Respondent was summoned for 19‑5‑2003; petitioner was absent.  
3. The Family Court dismissed the suit for non‑prosecution on 19‑5‑2003.  
4. Petitioner filed an application for restoration of the suit on 7‑8‑2003 (2 months 20 days after dismissal).  
5. The Family Court dismissed the application as barred by time on 25‑8‑2003.  
6. Petitioner appealed to the District Judge, Mekran Division, Turbat; the appeal was dismissed on 1‑12‑2003.  

**Holding / Decision:**  
The High Court dismissed the petition, holding that:  
- The application for restoration was filed beyond the 30‑day period prescribed by Article 163 of the Limitation Act;  
- The petitioner’s absence on 19‑5‑2003 was not justified by the death of a cousin and the ensuing funeral, as the delay was unreasonable;  
- The dismissal of the suit for non‑prosecution and the appellate dismissal were therefore proper.  

**Legal Principle Established:**  
An application for restoration of a suit dismissed for non‑prosecution must be filed within the 30‑day limitation period; failure to do so bars the application, and customary or personal circumstances such as a funeral do not excuse a delay beyond that period.
