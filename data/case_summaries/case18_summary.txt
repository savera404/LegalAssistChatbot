**Court:** Federal Shariat Court  

**Year:** 2000  

**Legal Issue:** Whether Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (VIII of 1961) are violative of the injunctions of Islam as set out in the Qur’an and Sunnah.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (VIII of 1961), Sections 4, 5, 6, 7  
- Constitution of Pakistan (1973), Articles 203‑B(C), 203‑D, 203‑G  
- Islamic jurisprudence (Qur’an, Sunnah)  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
- Petitioners (Allah Rakha and others) filed a series of Shariat petitions under Article 203‑D challenging the validity of the specified sections of the Ordinance.  
- The petitions were consolidated into a single judgment by the Federal Shariat Court.  
- The Ordinance was enacted to implement recommendations of a 1955 commission on marriage and family law; it has been subject to criticism by various ulema for alleged conflict with Islamic injunctions.  
- Earlier, the Peshawar High Court found Section 4 to be opposed to the injunctions of Islam; the Supreme Court set aside that judgment, holding the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the Muslim Personal Laws.
