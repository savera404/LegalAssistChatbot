Mst. Gaman v. Taj Din  

**Court:**  
Lahore High Court  

**Year:**  
1968  

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the Lahore High Court has jurisdiction to transfer a suit pending in one Family Court to another Family Court.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Article 102 of the Constitution of Pakistan (1962)  
- West Pakistan Family Courts Act (XXXV of 1964) – Sections 3, 14, 17, 24, 151  
- Constitution of Pakistan (1962) – Articles 102, 242  
- Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (1961)  
- Conciliation Courts Ordinance (1961)  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Petitioner filed a dissolution‑of‑marriage suit in the Family Court at Vehari (April 1967).  
2. Respondent filed a restitution‑of‑conjugal‑rights suit in the Family Court at Lahore (≈ 8 days later).  
3. Petitioner applied to the Lahore High Court (June 1967) under Sections 24 and 151 CPC and Article 102 to transfer the respondent’s suit to Vehari.  
4. Respondent had no objection to the transfer but argued the High Court lacked jurisdiction to transfer between subordinate courts.  

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Lahore High Court held that, under Article 102, it possesses supervisory jurisdiction over subordinate courts and may direct the transfer of suits between them. Consequently, the Court exercised its power to transfer the respondent’s suit from Lahore to Vehari.  

**Legal Principle Established:**  
A High Court’s superintendence under Article 102 includes the authority to transfer cases pending in subordinate courts to another subordinate court.
