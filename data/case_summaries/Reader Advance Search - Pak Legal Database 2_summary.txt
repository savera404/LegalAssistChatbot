**Case Name:**  
MST. NIG HAT AIJAZ (PETITIONER) v. MUHAMMAD JAMEEL (RESPONDENT)

**Court:**  
Sindh High Court

**Year:**  
1993

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether a Family Court may examine the validity of a marriage registered under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, in a suit for jactitation of marriage, and whether Section 23 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 bars such examination.

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 – Section 23 and the Schedule (items including jactitation of marriage)  
- Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (registration provisions)

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Respondent Muhammad Jameel alleges he married petitioner Mst. Nighat Aijaz on 10‑7‑1987, registered under the Ordinance, but petitioner never lived as his wife.  
2. Respondent filed Suit No. 32/1988 for restitution of conjugal rights; petitioner filed Suit No. 41/1988 for jactitation of marriage.  
3. Joint Civil Judge, Sukkur, dismissed the restitution suit and decreed the jactitation suit.  
4. Appeals to the Vth Additional District Judge, Sukkur, reversed both judgments: restitution suit decreed, jactitation suit dismissed.  
5. Petitioner filed Constitution petitions challenging the appellate judgment.

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Sindh High Court held that Section 23 does not preclude a Family Court from questioning the validity of a marriage in a suit for jactitation of marriage. The Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over such matters and may consider evidence of forged or fraudulent Nikahnama.

**Legal Principle Established:**  
Section 23 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, while preventing Family Courts from questioning the validity of a marriage registered in accordance with the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance in matters covered by the Schedule (items 1‑6), does not bar the Court from examining the validity of a marriage in a suit for jactitation of marriage. Consequently, the Family Court may entertain evidence of forgery or fraud affecting the marriage.
