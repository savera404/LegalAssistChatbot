**Case Name:** Liaqat Ali and others v. MST. Mehar Sheda and others  
**Court:** Peshawar High Court  
**Year:** 2010  

**Legal Issue:** Whether the judgment and decree dated 24‑4‑2008 dismissing the petitioners’ appeal, and the earlier mutations of Noor Khan’s legacy, were valid under the applicable Muslim Personal Law and whether the respondent’s claim to a Shari share was barred by limitation.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- North‑West Frontier Province Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act VI of 1935, Section 2  
- West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act V of 1962, Section 2  
- Specific Relief Act 1877, Section 42  
- Limitation Act (not specified)  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Respondent No. 1, daughter of Noor Khan, sued petitioners to obtain a declaration of her entitlement to a Shari share of Noor Khan’s legacy and to correct the revenue record.  
2. Petitioners claimed that Noor Khan’s property had been lawfully devolved to them through mutations No. 381 (23‑5‑1934) and No. 575 (29‑8‑1937) and that respondent No. 1 had no locus standi.  
3. The dispute concerns inheritance acquired before 16‑3‑1948, when customary law governed.  

**Holding / Decision:** The Peshawar High Court upheld the trial court’s judgment and decree, dismissing the petition. It held that the earlier mutations were lawful under the custom applicable at the time of Noor Khan’s death and that respondent No. 1’s claim was barred by limitation.  

**Legal Principle Established:** Inheritance cases involving estates acquired before 16‑3‑1948 are governed by the customary law in force at the time of death; claims under Muslim Personal Law are subject to the limitation provisions in force, and earlier mutations recorded under custom are valid if properly attested.
