**Case Name:**  
Abdul S Attar vs Mst. Zahida Parveen and 10 Others  

**Court:**  
Sindh High Court  

**Year:**  
1990  

**Legal Issue:**  
Whether the criminal complaint for “zina” filed by the respondent after a final decree of dissolution of marriage (and before the expiry of the Iddat period) was maintainable, and the effect of the dissolution decree under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance.  

**Relevant Law / Sections:**  
- Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (VIII of 1961) – Sections 7, 21, 8  
- Family Courts Act (XXXV of 1964) – Section 21  
- Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance (VII of 1979) – Section 10(2)  
- Penal Code – Sections 494, 109  

**Key Facts (brief):**  
1. Petitioner and respondent No. 1 married in 1981.  
2. Respondent filed a suit for dissolution in 1988; decree issued 2‑5‑1989.  
3. Respondent remarried 24‑5‑1989 before the Iddat period expired.  
4. Respondent lodged a criminal complaint under Section 10(2) of the Zina Ordinance in August 1989.  
5. Preliminary enquiry ordered 18‑8‑1989; complaint dismissed 23‑11‑1989.  
6. Criminal revision application filed; dismissed 7‑2‑1990.  

**Holding / Decision:**  
The Sindh High Court dismissed the criminal revision application, affirming that the dissolution decree was final and effective after service of notice to the Chairman and the 90‑day period, and that the criminal complaint for zina was not maintainable.  

**Legal Principle Established:**  
A decree of dissolution of marriage under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance becomes effective only after the required notice is served to the Chairman and the 90‑day period lapses; a subsequent remarriage before the Iddat period does not invalidate the decree, and a criminal complaint for zina based on such remarriage is not maintainable when the dissolution decree is final.
